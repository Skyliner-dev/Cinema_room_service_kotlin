This is the *Cinema Room REST Service (Kotlin)* project I made myself.


<p>Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? Having a booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/263?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/263</a>
